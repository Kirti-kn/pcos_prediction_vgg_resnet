# PCOS_prediction
- To use the model properly, create the 'pcos_module.h5' file and keep it in the same folder as 'app.py'.
- You can create the 'pcos_module.h5' file by two ways: <br>
  i) you can directly download the link of the model from the google drive link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NUn-JWigfMh56SJ__qSRGw1Qrl8ct6Sw/view?usp=sharing <br> keep the 'pcos_module.h5' file in the same folder as 'app.py'. Make sure to extract the file if it is downloaded as a zip file. ( The size of file is large due to which I was not able to upload it in the github)<br> <br>
                                        OR <br><br>
  ii) You can download the 'train_directory2' folder from the google drive (link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1k_tV_tJhSrGmh6_KkqY-D_Wp8nUuSP-a?usp=sharing ) , which contains the dataset for the model. Keep the 'train_directory2' in the same folder as 'model.py' and run 'model.py' to create 'pcos_module.h5'. ( The size of file is large due to which I was not able to upload it in the github)<br> <br>

- Download all the files in this github repo and surely extract all the zip files before running the program.
- After successfully setting up, run the 'app.py' file.
